//! Superoptimizer written in Rust
//! ------------------------------
//! This program stochastically generates assembly language programs that compute a given function.
//! Strop provides mechanisms for generating programs, and mutating them in ways that
//! stochastically approach the desired output.
//!
//! Another way to describe strop, is that it randomly generates pretty good assembly programs.
//!
//! So far, strop has had a focus on supporting architectures that are not well supported by
//! mainstream compilers such as LLVM. These have included architectures common in low-end
//! embedded, and hobbyist retrocomputing.
