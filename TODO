here's a dsecription of a basic genetic alogrithm

start with a population of random code sequences

Selection:
    this is about selecting the best performers and knocking off the worst
    two methods:
    1. Roulette wheel selection
    2. Tournament selection

Crossover:
    pick two parents
    take first half of parent A + second half of parent B to create child 1
    take first half of parent B + second half of parent A to create child 2

Mutation:
    Pick a random point in the code sequence and mutate somethnig there.
    Typically mutation rate is much lower than the crossover rate

Elitism:
    Pick the best solutions and just copy them to the next generation

So generation by generation, the best fitness and average fitness will
increase.
But eventually this curve will taper off, which is normally a good time to
terminate the search
